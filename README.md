## üéØ Features

- The ES cluster must be deployed in a K8s (Kubernetes) cluster.
- The team already owns a K8s cluster, so provisioning a K8s cluster is not
  a part of the requested solution.
- The ES cluster can be deployed using any tool to manage K8s workloads: vanilla
  manifests, CRDs, Helm charts, kustomize, etc.
- The ES cluster‚Äôs configuration must ensure availability of the ES cluster
  during failures in the underlying hardware and regular maintenance operations
  in the K8s cluster.
- The ES roles assigned to each of the ES nodes must be identical for all nodes
  in the ES cluster.
- The solution is shared with the team via either a zip-file or a Git(Hub)
  repository containing everything to deploy an ES cluster.
- The solution contains a README, explaining:
  - How the solution should be used to deploy the ES cluster.
  - What design decisions have been made in this solution (cluster
    configuration, used tools, etc.).
- The solution is functional and results in a running ES cluster if the README
  instructions are followed.
